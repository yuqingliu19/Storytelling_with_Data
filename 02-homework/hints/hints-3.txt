Just like last time, each rectangle is one of these lines:

  <rect x="75" y="75" width="20" height="20" fill="darkred"></rect>












The SVG is 200 pixels wide, and 200 pixels tall. You can tell if you look at the <svg> tag:

  <svg height="200" width="200">
    <rect x="75" y="75" width="20" height="20" fill="darkred"></rect>
    <rect x="120" y="100" width="20" height="20" fill="teal"></rect>
    <rect x="75" y="125" width="20" height="20" fill="teal"></rect>
  </svg>














Since the x and y are the TOP and LEFT of the rect, if you set the x or the y to 200, the boxes will fall outside of the SVG and disappear! You need to pay attention to their height and width.

















Also, since rectangles are position from the top left, you can't use 100 as the x coordinate for the red one. That will push it a little too far to the right.
