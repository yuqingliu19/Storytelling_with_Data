You might not know HTML, but don't worry, it takes about 45 seconds to learn. It's built up of things called TAGS. Tags usually look like this:

  <h1>This is a number one headline</h1>
  <h3>This is a number three headline</h3>

  <p>This is a paragraph</p>

The <h1> means "I'm about to start a headline!!!" and the </h1> means "okay I'm done with the headline!!!". That's honestly about all there is to it.



















We're going to be editing this line:

  <circle cx="100" cy="100" fill="lightblue" r="50">

Which says "make me a lightblue-filled circle with a radius of 50. Place its center on the x axis at 100, and its center on the y axis at 100."


















lightblue is a named color. While you probably shouldn't use named colors in normal practice, here's a list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#X11_color_names

You can probably guess what the color pink is called, though.













r means radius.
