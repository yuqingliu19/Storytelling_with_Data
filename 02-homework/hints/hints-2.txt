The grey area is boundaries of the svg - the drawing area for the graphic we're making.














Each rectangle is one of these lines:

  <rect x="146" y="5" width="20" height="20"></rect>














The 'x' and 'y' for the rectangle are the LEFT and the TOP of the rectangle.













Remember how you colored in the circle in the first question? It's the same here.
