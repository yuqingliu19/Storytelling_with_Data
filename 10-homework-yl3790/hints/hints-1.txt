If your pie is off of the side of the page, think about where 0,0 is and how to move it there.













pies require two pieces: a pie and an arc. The pies provide the angles, the arcs provide the radii




















When building a pie chart, if you have 3 data points you'll also want 3 wedges.













Something is weird about binding data when building a pie chart! Or different, at least.












And whenever you're doing function(d) stuff, be sure to console.log(d) to see what your data looks like, because something changes about it.

















3 slices, so 3 wedges. 3 slices, so 3 labels.


















In class we always centered the labels with .attr("text-anchor", "middle"), but you can also say "if it's on the right hand side of the circle, left-align. if it's on the left, right-align." That code is:

.attr("text-anchor", function(d) {
	if(d.startAngle > Math.PI) {
	  return "end"
	} else {
	  return "start"
	}
})



















If the pie slices all seem to be the same color, try console.log(d) to remind yourself what data looks like when you're making a pie graph.
