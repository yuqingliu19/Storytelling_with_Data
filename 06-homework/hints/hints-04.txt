You need all the normal stuff - position scales, etc. You don't actually need a color scale, though!















The sneaky trick to highlighting one specific thing is to say "hey, are you France? If so, let's make you blue. otherwise let's just make you grey."










...that means you'll want to use an if statement.



















...inside of the function(d) that you're using to specify fill.

















You have 45 data points, but only want to draw 3 lines. How do you make that happen?












When working with text, you set the actual text with...
.text("Text goes here")














If you watn to do it on a per-text-element basis? Well.... function(d).














You can add the text at the end of the line one of two ways:
1) The cheating way, where you just manually position it. That's not a big deal, fine, fine, fine. You can manually append 3 different text elements.
2) The smart way, where you use selectAll + data, and position it automatically, using only last data point. You want to have the same number of text elements as you do line elements
3) Okay okay there's a third way that involves an if statement as to whether it's the country you're interested in













Adding a dot at the end is the same.
