This is kind of the same thing as the last graph. Maybe you can cut and paste? BUT REMEMBER: we're using a different div with a different id!













Yeah, the y axis doesn't mean anything in this case. But that doesn't mean we can ignore it! We should probably put them in the center.














Kind of animal is a color. We've used linear scales with color, but that's when you're saying "the more dogs you own, the darker blue you are." In this case, we're saying "each one of these categories should be each one of these other categories," e.g. dog is brown and cat is blue. You use an ordinal scale for this. You actually don't need to specify a domain, but you can if you want!













Remember that we can't use a linear scale with radius! We're measuring area, so we need a different kind of scale.
















(A square root kind of scale)















Opacity makes things see-through
