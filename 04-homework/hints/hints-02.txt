You're going to delete the var svg= line, but you'll need another var svg=... line to replace it.












It's the second one we did in class, I think. The longer, more complicated one.



















The var svg=... line refers to a variable called "margins", so make sure you cut and paste that one, too.
















By "a line" I mean "a bunch of lines that are connected to each other," it's probably more like 10 lines of code.

















Technically speaking, you're grabbing the div, adding an svg, sizing the svg, then adding a "g" element inside of the svg. It's just an element used to space things out, and we spend our time pretending it's an SVG.














In class, we were drawing inside of <div id="chart"></div> - this time we're drawing inside of <div id="chart2"></div>












#chart is how you grab something with an ID of 'chart'. We don't have an id of chart (see above).















Take some time to read the margin variable names. You'll get it.
