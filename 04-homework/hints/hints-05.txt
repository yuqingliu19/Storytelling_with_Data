Oh boy, there's a lot of stuff to do here.

STEP ONE: Start off by BUILDING YOUR SVG. This is the whole 'margins blah blah svg blah blah' part. Confirm it worked by making sure there's a big grey box where nothing used to be.



















STEP TWO: Then you can add your marks. What kind of elements do you use for a scatterplot?











This is where you have to select the circles (even though they don't exist), bind the data, and do the enter/append thing.















Give them all the same position and at first. You just want to have some ugly circles in the top left-hand corner.












cx and cy, not x and y!













STEP THREE: Build your scales. You'll need two - one for the x position and one for the y position.










Please call them xPositionScale and yPositionScale.













Because they're normal number scales (halfway through the input = halfway through the output), we'll stick with a linear scale.














 What's the max input and max output for each of them?











Make sure you're doing domain([0,1]) instead of domain(1,2)!













STEP FOUR: Use those scales to position your circles












Remember, cx and cy, not x and y!














You want a different value for each one, right? So you might need our good friend function(d).

















STEP FIVE: Cut and paste the axis code from class and you should be all set! Make sure it's inside the ready function.
