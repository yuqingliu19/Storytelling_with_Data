For each one of these scales, you'll need to specify the inputs and outputs. What are inputs called in a d3 scale? What are outputs called?














When you're passing the inputs and outputs, make sure you're sending a list. If you use ([1, 2]) it will work, if you use (1, 2) it won't work.













For the linear scale, think about the smallest and largest inputs, and the smallest and largest outputs.
















For the category scale - the ordinal scale - you'll need to give it every possible input, and every possible output.
