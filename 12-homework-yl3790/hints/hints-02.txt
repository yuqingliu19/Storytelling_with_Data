It's just like what we did in class where we selected based on continent.























there is no 'hover' event, as you know! it's one for the mouse going on, and one for the mouse going off.

























1) Give everything a class
2) Select based on that class
3) Make changes















Everything needs classes based on the state name, but watch out - it isn't always d.state since sometimes the data is nested! how do you get the group name for nested data?



















And watch out for spaces and capital letters, they're both evil.





















Now when you do this, you're going to have a weird thing since you're trying to deal with both LINES as well as CIRCLES and TEXT. So if I say, "find me everything california and make the fill blue" then that would work for circles but not for lines, y'know? So you need to say "find me all of the california circles" or "find me all of the california text"

But that's possible! It happens like this:

  svg.selectAll("text.california")

But of course you're going to need to build "text.california" from a variable.






















Be sure to return everything to normal when you're done hovering. Some things use scales, some things don't!
