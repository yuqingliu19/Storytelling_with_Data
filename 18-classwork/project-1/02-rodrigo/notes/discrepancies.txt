NOTES: Paulo César Caju, Pelé, Sócrates, Jair Rosa Pinto, Pepe, Didi, Waldemar de Brito, Baltazar, Nilo, Heleno de Freitas, Quarentinha, Carvalho Leite, Vavá, Cláudio Adão, Gérson, Patusko, Julinho Botelho, Roberto Dinamite, Careca, Zizinho, Lêonidas da Silva, Garrincha, Jairzinho, Tostão and Rivellino tallies count only Fifa "A" games. They differ from some of the other goal counts avaliable, but are the only ones with a yearly breakdown avaliable for those players. Since in the first half of the XX century there were fewer official international matches - and many more unofficial friendlies, often with bad record-keeping - the goal count for some of those players is underestimated. 

NO RELIABLE DATA OR HUGE DISCREPANCIES:
